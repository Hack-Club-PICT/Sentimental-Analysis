# Sentimental-Analysis

This is the first project of Hack Club PICT

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Since it is a supervised learning task we are provided with a training data set which consists of Tweets labeled with “1” or “0” and a test data set without labels. The training and test data sets can be found here.
label “0”: Positive Sentiment
label “1”: Negative Sentiment
